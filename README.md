# Jojawhi's Tic Tac Toe assignment for The Odin Project

A Tic Tac Toe browser game .

## Learning Focus

This project's focus was on factory functions, modules, and practice manipulating scope and context in objects.

## Takeaway

Although the project focus was supposed to be factory functions, at the advice of a mentor, I chose to use ES6 classes instead. It was my first time using classes, and they seem pretty powerful. One of the 'tricks' I picked up in this practice was passing parameters from a parent function as parameters in a child function.

## Future Additions

  - Add AI for single player vs computer

## Known Bugs
