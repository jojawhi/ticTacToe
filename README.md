# Jojawhi's Tic Tac Toe assignment for The Odin Project

A Tic Tac Toe browser game .

## Learning Focus

This project's focus was on factory functions, modules, and practice manipulating scope and context in objects.

## Takeaway

Although the project focus was supposed to be factory functions, at the advice of a mentor, I chose to try doing with ES6 classes instead. It was my first time using classes, and they seem pretty powerful.

## Future Additions

  - Add AI for single player vs computer

## Known Bugs

- endGame modal animation delay not currently working
